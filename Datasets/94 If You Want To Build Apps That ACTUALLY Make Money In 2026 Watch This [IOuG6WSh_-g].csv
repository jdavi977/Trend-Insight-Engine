"Im a QA software engineer that does not know how to develop a web or mobile app. I got an idea to build a calisthenics web app and test it along the way as a tester, something that would help me with my progression in calisthenics. As a person that likes to be active in the gym and wants to learn calisthenics on the way i thought this would be a cool project to build both helping me with my progression with calisthenics and learn how to develop something. Yes there are a lot of things out there already regarding this but I want to shoot my shot. Was wondering if you would have any tips for me. Appreciate your content!","@KonuralpCabuk","6"
