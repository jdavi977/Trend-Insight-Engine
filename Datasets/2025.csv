"Great video. I have been having these discussions for over twenty years. I got my first computer in 1985. Watched war games and told my mum - one day all computers will be linked and I can have friends all over the world. I became a web designer in 1994 and was a web developer for over twenty years. I have experienced and contributed to the bubbles. This feels different. The technology has met the globalists agenda. This is it people - buckle up. I am a 53 year old creative and since the inception of OpenAi and generative AI, and painfully watched it develop into a creativity devouring behemoth. But as the fears of 1994 were it would be the end of printing, the current fears that it will end human creativity, is unfounded. It has a place as a tool to release the ideas faster. It’s a wonderful testing tool for all that you wish. For the older generation, we either embrace it, and find a place for it in our lives and stop reacting in fear or it devours us too.

"The thing that always concerns me with videos like this, is that they just look at the positives of these different periods of innovations. Take the post civil war error that he mentioned. Yes there was great economic growth for a number of people, particularly those who ventured west, claimed land, and benefited from a booming economy. But this was also the period where the railroad opened up every natural resoruce of the west, facilitated the slaughter of Native americans and many wildlife species & ecosystems (think bison, passenger pigeons, wolves & grizzlies), and kick started our addiction to fossil fuels, which arguably has killed 100x times more people around the world since the civil war than the actual war did itself. The same can be applied to the industrial boom of the 40-70''s. Yes there was great economic opportunity for people after the war, but it really laid the ground for the addictions we face today centred around personal automobiles, cheap consumer items, and heavily processed food, and the challenges we also face around housing and cost of living. And then the start of the digital age helped to connect the world in so many ways, and created the globalised society we today live in, but the negatives around being addicted to online spaces, and the impact that has on our relationships, careers, and personal wellbeing is never addressed by the same players that created said circumstances. For every step forward humanity makes, we often take 10 steps back if innovation occurs rapidly without giving us time to think, plan and regulate effectively.   And by my estimation, this next technological boom will result in exactly the same thing. AI might make our daily lives more efficient, but because those efficiency improvements are most commonly focused around human labour needs, it will just result in mass joblessness. And the thought that this would actually be redistributed is fanciful, as the technology is wielded by just the top 0.001% of society, that also have incredible influence over the governments of the world. In short, there is no way that these gains will actually be shared across the world. Yes renewables may help us overcome our addiction to fossil fuels, bit it creates a new addiction to various rare earth elements that nations are currently fighting wars over, the control of which will also dictate the flow of money to the citizens of the world. And the promises around CRISPR technology is definitely impressive, but it could also be terrifying if used to create super viruses, unkillable bacteria, or diseases the target specific ethnicities or genetic groups. Or even if it isn''t intentionally used for mass harm, what if the lab cultured beef unknowingly creates the perfect environment for ultra transmissible strains of mad cow, TB, Brucelosis, and since the tissue is not contained within a body with a functioning immune system, those pathogens spread quickly to the consumers buying said product? When technologies rapidly develop, and we just kick back and let it run it''s course, they arguably do more harm than good over the long run, by concentrating power with those who are irresponsible to wield it, and creating a litany of unintended consequences that we can''t turn back the clock on.","@fillthefreezer8413",""

To me it''s not entirely convincing to break up history in similar chunk with similar pauses in between. The rate of change and development has been increasing logarithmically so I can''t really compare 250 years ago to today''s development cycles.  (Also on the point of clean energy, it''s a bit reductive to say that solar energy for example is a technology and not a commodity. It still requires extraction of resources, but rather than large quantities of bulk resources instead now relies on extremely rare, difficult to extract resources. It''s still a positive regardless, but mostly since it doesn''t rely on irreplaceable organic material, but instead on elements we can find easily all over the solar system.

"There''s some interesting ideas here but also a lot wrong with it.   - The iphone wasn''t particularly revolutionary. The computer/digital age was a revolution, the iphone was just one small step in that.  We''d already got the internet, desktop computers, traditional mobile phones, then mobile computers (""smartphones"") in the form of 1st blackberry and Microsoft, followed by the more modern take on mobile computers pioneered by both iPhone and Android, etc.  It was a fairly significant step, but in terms of the overall digital revolution it was just one of many pieces of the jigsaw.   - It''s very America-centric view, and those 80-25 year periods seems like a case of correlation is not necessarily causation. There is a chance that the civil unrest and social/political situations could be connected to that pattern, as that''s how long it takes for a generation to age out that learnt the lessons from the last conflict, but it''s not related to technology.  They''re also quite arbitrary start-stop markers of those time periods, in reality most of them were a much more gradual transition, and there were many other huge changes not captured in those time blocks.   - ChatGPT was a breakthrough, but not a revolutionary one. ""AI"" is certainly going to completely dwarf human intelligence at some point, but we''re not any closer now than we were 10 years ago.  For now all we''ve really achieved is ChatGPT/LLMs and picture/video generation, neither of which is true general intelligence.  Both of which have limited usefullness, LLMs in particular have very little real world application.  We don''t know when the next breakthrough in AI is going to be, could be very soon or it could be decades or even centuries away, either way it won''t be connected to the last breakthrough.  We''ve still not found much real world usefulness of LLMs, or pic/vid generation.  There''s also the insane cose of AI, both financially and environmentally.... it''s being funded by the stock market hype bubble at the moment, but once we have to start paying for it ourselves, even what we have now might suddenly fall off a cliff.   - There is no rise of clean energy. It''s a myth.  Something to placate people to stop them worrying about how we''re killing the planet, an excuse to silence their conscience and keep buying more stuff and keep breeding.  Solar panels and wind turbines help to mitigate it, a little bit, but that''s all.  They don''t have the reliability, flexibility, or scalability; and we have no way of buffering/storing it in sufficient quantities.  The closest thing we have to clean energy is nuclear, and again there''s no revolutions in nuclear since the 50s, continued improvement yes, but nothing revolutionary.   - Battery tech hasn''t significantly changed since the 70s. Lithium Ion batteries were invented in the 70s, and they haven''t changed significantly since.  All we''ve done since is commercialise and industrialise them.  It might seem like they''re getting better, but they''re not.  Tesla didn''t make better batteries, they just shoved an insanely large (and heavy!) amount of them in a car.  Solid states and other promised revolutionary battery tech are so far just hot air, nobody''s been able to nail a practical battery to beat Lithium yet despite the massive amount of money and research that''s already been poured into it over the last few decades, so the chances are they''re not going to.  We''re still not any closer.   - A future of ""sustained capitalism"" is laughably optimistic.  We''re currently on a steep downwards trajectory to an increasingly worse dystopia, and possibly a complete collapse of the financial system.  Capitalism has never been more messed up.  - I don''t know how you can say we''re closer to ""global governance"", when the conflicts between nations, between oligarchs, and between the rich and poor is the worst it''s been since WW2.  If anything we''re at a boiling point with civil wars, WW3, and nuclear annihilation all breathing down our necks.","@mrfish9876",""

"Renewable energy which eventually allow us to have as much clean energy and dirt cheap as we want will open up a lot of possibilities and reduce the cost of energy as well as energy security, especially in countries where energy prices are high and/or they don''t produce much fossil fuels, those countries will likely get a big economic boom thanks to that, so most of Europe, Japan and many others.  As for AI, this is going to be a major game changer, and even more so once we throw robotics in the mix, as we are talking about using AI to assist us in getting things done and even replacing us in a lot of fields, throw robotics in the mix and that''s going to do much of the same thing in the physical world, the way our capitalist world works now, AI and robotics is likely going to take over almost all jobs as well as future jobs we create, capitalism by its nature will pressure companies to cut cost and boost productivity, whether we like it or not, humans are a major cost in the job market and most businesses will find ways to cut us out, and on top of all this, consumers will always be pulled towards cheaper and better products, something AI will eventually be able to deliver on both fronts, when you put it together, workers are going to get squeezed from both ends to the point that there are few workers left.  The above isn''t a problem if we do major changes to the system, but with the current system, it''s a disaster that could lead to massive inequality, especially in countries with weak social systems like the US, China and many others, we already see it in the US, the government and big corporations are seeing AI as a way to boost wealth for themselves, not for all, and the individual nature of how people think in the US could end up meaning massive wealth in few hands and the rest of the population being thrown under a bus, unless there''s major changes to the system which seems unlikely any time soon.  Contrast that with social democracies like in Europe, the system is already in place to distribute wealth towards the population, basically, as AI and robotics do there thing to generate a lot of wealth, it''s likely the people in Europe and other social democracies will see the benefits of that wealth a lot more compared to countries like the US or China were too much of that wealth will likely end up in too few hands.  When you throw in that Europe, especially EU countries have some of the highest energy bills in the world, produce so few fossil fuels and have a strong social democracy, AI, robotics and renewable energy could lead to a massive economic boom which could lead to a golden age, and I think in the US, the transition won''t be smooth with things likely to get worse before they get better, maybe a revolution will be needed, In Europe and other social democracies, the transition will likely be much smoother because much of the system is already in place to allow it to deal with it, it''s just a matter of massively expanding the social programs which AI and robotics will give the resources to allow, it''s a major difference in thinking where the US has individual thinking whiles Europe has cooperative thinking, and it''s going to be interesting to see how that plays out.","@paul1979uk2000",""

The USA also is a major emitter whose current administration has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, stifled new & proposed renewable energy projects and implemented pro-oil policies to encourage extraction, particularly in South America, Africa, the Middle East & potentially in Arctic regions (viz. Alaska, Greenland?).  Then there is Russia.  Another major emitter, India, also harbours more people than any other nation alone & growth is not expected to peak until the mid-2060s. All of these nations are heavily involved in commercial development of AI & weapons/defence. Both the race to recover rare earths & other minerals critical to these pursuits & their high energy demands threaten to extend the period within which ''net zero'' ultimately is achieved.  It was always the case that the level of atmospheric carbon would remain high after net zero & would drop only when the rate of fixation/sequestration exceeded the rate of emissions (i.e. ''beyond net zero''). Considering current national trends, it would not be unreasonable to concede ''net zero'' most likely will be realised after 2060.

"""Tax the rich at 90%..."".  So tired of this misleading argument cropping up again and again.  The marginal tax rate is NOT how much someone actually pays in taxes. They set the marginal tax rate at 90% in the 1950''s because there were so many tax loop holes and write-offs that the rich were hardly paying any taxes at all.  So they jacked up the marginal tax rate to compensate for this.  However the EFFECTIVE tax rate for the wealthy during this time was in the area of 30-35%.  The effective tax rate is how much people ACTUALLY pay.  The effective tax rate for the wealthy today in the U.S. is only a little below what is was during the 1950''s (please look it up).  In fact besides during WW2 when taxes went up massively for everyone (rich and poor) the effective tax rate for the wealthy has been remarkably consistent since WW2. So PLEASE stop with this misleading argument that implies you can massively tax the wealthy and it has no major effect on the economy.  It simply isn''t true. And I say that is someone who thinks the effective tax rate for the wealthy in the U.S. should probably be raised by about 5-10%.","@jeffb1880",""

"Splendid discussion! Very astute observations indeed. Thank you for this video. I would like to add a very important revolutionary development you seemed to have touched upon. The computation revolution. We are seeing an exponential outburst of unthinkable computational paradigms even today. To list a few:  1. Quantum computing 2. Quantum communication 3. Different approaches to different classical modes of computation like photonic chips, thermodynamic chips, neuromorphic chips, ternary computing, analog computing, etc. 3. Exponential improvements in power efficiency, compute density per volume, and physical dimensions of a computing surface overall, all for standard computing hardware 4. Nanotechnology, robotics, and space exploration (how long before we discover FTL travel?)  This is not theory or science fiction, these developments are happening *right now*, some even at the cusp of commercialization.  An important distinction from the line of thinking presented in this video, but something you explored at the very end, is that the revolution that''s coming will affect the entire world at a massive scale across many dimensions. And although we are starting to feel the effects in 2025 already, I believe things will be in full-swing by the middle or end of 2027.  These technologies are revolutionary enough just alone, but they will only propel each other forward at an astonishing pace, and when they combine with AI we will enter a monumental, planetary, and societal shift.","@ajays6393",""

He liked talking about the great depression well its happening again there will be no time of prosperity just more wealth transferred to the rich. He will get to see the middle class destroyed by the fiscal actions of baby boomers. I will guess this though,  the 1% will keep gaining in the times to come. You like studying history so much? Study the fall of civilizations that had middle classes you will see it all starts with the destruction of the middle class in said societies.

Idk who this guy is but he mentioned being approached in the early days of Wired… these tech bros have been intentionally pushing towards technofuedalism first using tech optimism through the 90s and 2000s to gain capital and political favour then influencing laws and forming gigantic tech monopolies with unprecedented political power. His video conveniently skips over the thousands of Americans who joined unions and fought and died for workers rights leading to the new deal. The west and the rest of the world history has been shaped by the principal contradiction: the class struggle.  Edit: Just reached the end of the video. Global governance? This is the end goal for this new breed of capitalists. The west already pushes its economic interests onto the global south through forms of “global governance”. If tech guys get that kind of power, we’re headed straight into the mega corps of the Alien universe.
