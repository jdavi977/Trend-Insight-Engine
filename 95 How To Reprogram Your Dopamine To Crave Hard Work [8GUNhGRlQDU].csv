"1) Take boring breaks. Do NOT do things in your break time that give you MORE dopamine than the tasks you do after your break time. 2) Take control of ""In-Between"" moments(Waiting for your order, Walking to a bus stop, Standing in line, etc...!) in your daily life where you take out your phone for a quick dopamine hit and replace it with something boring. 3) Do things ONE thing at a time. When you are eating, eat. When you are working, work. Stop multitasking and put full focus on 1 thing whatever it is.","@nivk9445","17K"

"As I''ve been trying to improve my mental health one thing I started doing was trying to do only one thing at a time. The reasoning was that too much stimulation (multitasking, constant input like music or videos, social media) was one of the things making my brain overly jumpy and causing constant anxious thoughts and, if gone unnoticed for too long, would lead to panic attacks. I''m still in a ""transition period"" but it has been helping a LOT, and wow, this video is exactly what I needed to actually get work done. ""boring breaks"" is definitely what I need, I even sort of started doing those by just sitting and doing absolutely nothing as another way to minimize that terror of being alone with my thoughts. If i stop giving my brain constant information to process, it''ll settle back down. Funny how I was kinda doing what this video was saying, but for completely different reasons! Time to actually get things done then...!","@FrilledMayfly_AmberlyFerrule","44"
"Its clear that you put a lot of time and work into making your videos interesting and entertaining. The constant camera shots and text and snippets of videos (someone snowboarding, ice, stacks of paper, scrolling an inbox, changing the camera view, text on the screen...etc) make it very difficult to actually concentrate on what youre saying. For smeone who appreciates slowing life down and meditating and appreciating the smaller things, your videos - changing whats on screen every 5 seconds, would communicate the opposite.  Is this because you think that we''re so distracted these days that you have to constantly illustrate every new idea or else we will be bored?","@str8poosing","43"
"I remember before starting my ADHD therapy that I had always to have some sort of stimulation. Now since I started, taking my meds, listining to advice online, my habits have started to shift too. Some consciously some subconsciously. One of the best things was switching from driving bus to the cycle every single day to work. I could still listen to music or podcasts while driving but I learned to enjoy just driving and being alone with my thoughts. It has become meditative and enjoyable to the point I don''t care if it is freezing or sunny. I ride my bike. At work instead of taking my phone to the coffee machine I just look out of the window at the sky. My attention span is still almost the same garbage but at least I can engage better and better on the ""boring"" tasks. I am slow but I am slowly getting stuff done. This is progress finally.","@NeoStarImpact","40"
"I think this video really helped me. I‘ve been talking to my friends and I found out the reason I reach for my phone is also due to my anxiety cause I am scared to sit in silence and let my thoughts wander.

"This isn''t the usual but lately and by lately I mean around the beggining of this week I''ve been noticing my attention span shortening. I don''t know how I''m even aware of it. And I started to crave social media in times were I would just focus on for example, eating, cooking, working out, doing homework.

I might need a social media-detox."" I believe if I implement everything in this video I might not only return to my usual self but infact improve myself. Thank you for the clear information.

"This actually makes so much sense to me. My boyfriend naturally incorporates all of this without thinking about it. I always thought he has a superpower because he can focus for hours and actually be productive. He could learn a whole new programming language and start building apps with it within hours. Now that I think about it, I would call him sometimes and he would be in the forest taking a walk or just sitting staring at a river for an hour or so.  He also sleeps a lot, no less than 10 hours a day. But this actually works better than forcing your body to wake up early only to get nothing done because you’re so tired. This also makes him way less stressed about time and deadlines because he knows he can hyper focus whenever he wants. And yes he is unable to multitask. It is literally impossible for him to hold a conversation while texting or doing anything that takes some focus. I am definitely going to incorporate these tricks because god do I need this to achieve my goals! Thanks for the video man","@Hithere-321","19"

"Boring breaks is a really great advice, but a concerning question here is by starving your brain from dopamine so much, at the end of the day you''re still the same caged rat craving, its just that now if you''re suddenly exposed to a less sensitive reward like scrolling social media, you ain''t stopping that easy.   Its like a middle class guy was struck by poverty got rich overnight so wouldn''t be able to handle success that well and make dumb mistakes.

"Taking boring breaks was the best advice ever. I was doing breaks with social media scrolling and many times it was taking me away from work. I will do boring breaks now, thank you very much for this insight!!!","@BrisaRuiva","4"
"Very important to note, is that you also need to make ''productive''/''important'' tasks more rewarding for yourself. Simply ''removing'' dopamine from your life (i.e. taking boring breaks, no phone in between things). Is not enough. It makes other (productive) things more stimulating in comparison. But your brain needs a certain level of dopamine and will likely get frustrated if you don''t give it this.   So the advice in the video is good, but you should also try and make your work more rewarding/stimulating. For example by watching videos or reading articles related to the topic to become more interested, or by making sure doing the task feels better, for example by working in a pleasant enviroment or making sure you''re well rested and fed. This will make the task more rewarding and easier. Which will make you more productive, while at the same time making social media etc less appealing.","@aukemeijer1762","4"

"4:34 ""The critical mistake when doing something in breaks that is more stimulating than the actual work you are doing"". After hearing this I realized something mind blowing, we think we are one being but its not, as a practicing Muslim it is warned by God in our holy book many times that don''t become salve of your human instincts, those who do that are like dogs. its been few days but I am brainwashing myself to ""like hard task"", keep showing myself the picture of what i can become, for example I am studying a Python language package and thier is a bug that they have not solved yet, not its a hard task to go through their code line by and line and figure out the problem but the way i motivated myself to do it is I told myself imagine the level I gain when I solve this. I also vision myself as being who is addicted to constantly improve itself every day and Its working I replace my idle time with physical exercises and its working I am also gaining muscles now, my dopamine is now linked to the results I am getting. I also avoid overworking and I hit the sweat spot where I don''t over do something.","@Sir-Ahmad-Khan","11"

"Here is how you can ""reprogram"" your dopamine, explained simply: What is Dopamine? Imagine dopamine is the excitement juice or the ""more"" molecule in your brain. • Dopamine gives you a reward when you do certain activities. It makes you want to do more of whatever gave you that reward. • When you scroll through TikTok or play a video game, your brain gets a huge, easy splash of dopamine. This is called overstimulation. • The problem is that if you get constant, huge splashes of excitement juice (dopamine), your brain gets used to it. Soon, your brain needs more and more stimulation just to feel a little bit rewarded, like needing ice cream, video games, and scrolling all at once. • The work you need to do—like learning a new skill or finishing your homework—can''t compete with that huge splash, so it feels dull and boring. • The goal is to stop needing huge amounts of stimulation to feel rewarded and instead become highly sensitive, so even a nice song or a beautiful sunset feels exciting. You can''t truly ""detox"" dopamine because it''s a neurochemical your brain needs to function. Instead, you want to master your dopaminergic system by making the boring tasks feel rewarding. 3 Simple Ways to Reprogram Your Dopamine To make hard work feel as exciting as scrolling through social media, you need to follow these three steps: 1. Take ""Boring Breaks"" When you are working hard and need a break, the natural thing to do is check your phone or social media. But those activities are more stimulating than the work itself, which makes it much harder to go back to the work because your work now feels even duller. • The Rule: Take boring breaks that starve your brain of dopamine. • What to do: Instead of checking your phone, spend five to ten minutes doing something simple and non-stimulating. You could stare at a blank wall, drink a cup of tea, or simply let the thoughts in your head ""settle"". • Why it works: You want the dopamine-seeking part of your brain to crave getting back to work rather than staying stuck on the fun break activity. When you starve your brain of that easy excitement, going back to your homework feels like a fun reward. 2. Habit the ""In Between"" We often reach for our phones or look for quick distraction during those small moments when we are waiting for something—like waiting in line, sitting alone at lunch, or commuting. This is unintentional information consumption that fractures your attention. • The Rule: Inhabit the ""in between"" by tolerating moments without much stimulation. • What to do: When you arrive early to a meeting, sit quietly without your phone. When you are commuting or waiting in line, just pay attention to your breath or surroundings. • Why it works: Allowing yourself to settle in these quiet moments—forcing yourself to be present—makes you more and more sensitive to reward over time. Your brain''s baseline for what feels boring will shift, which is helpful for deep focus. 3. Do Everything One Thing at a Time Your brain is constantly trying to quickly shift between different things, especially when you multitask. • The Rule: Focus on one thing at a time with singular focus. • What to do: When you are eating, just eat. When you are talking to someone, just talk to them. When you are working on a task, just work on that task. If you get a distracting thought, jot it down in a notebook and go right back to the work, rather than acting on the thought. • Why it works: This trains your brain to shift its focus really fast. The faster you can focus on one thing, the more focusing neurochemistry (dopamine) gets funnelled into your system. This increased dopamine makes the focused work feel good and rewarding","@SmartSync-k9w","5"
"After 2 years of searching for dopamine detoxification, I behold this video to everyone as the key to detox dopamine. While doing pomodoro, taking 5 min of highly dopamine activity is the wrong thing thatkept me lagging behind.

"I tested it for myself, when you change the focus from ''it''s difficult'' to ''it''s a challenge'', it really works! The first days are unusual, but then you get involved.","@limitless-Code",""
"Here is a summary of the key points from the video:  - Dopamine is the ""molecule of more"" that drives us to seek rewards and stimulation. But overstimulation can desensitize us to dopamine''s effects.   - To resensitize ourselves to dopamine, we should take boring breaks, inhabit the in-between moments without stimulation, and focus on one thing at a time. This boosts impulse control and makes tasks more rewarding.  - Take breaks that are more boring than your work. Go for a walk, stare at a wall, etc. Don''t distract yourself with your phone.   - Inhabit the in-between moments by just being present instead of constantly seeking stimulation.   - Do one thing at a time with full focus. This strengthens your ability to shift into an attentive state and makes tasks more engaging.  - Mastering your dopamine system this way can make the boring rewarding. You can achieve flow states more easily and turn work into play.  In summary, we should avoid overstimulation, take boring breaks, focus singularly, and resensitize ourselves to dopamine in order to boost productivity, focus, and flow.","@md82892","32"

"STEP-BY-STEP PROTOCOL 1. Take boring breaks that are less stimulating than your work to reset dopamine sensitivity 2. Use wall staring, napping, walking, or mindfulness instead of social media during breaks 3. Inhabit the in-between moments without your phone when waiting in lines or commuting 4. Practice single-tasking by doing one thing at a time with complete focus 5. Lower your stimulation baseline so work becomes as rewarding as scrolling social media  DOPAMINE RESENSITIZATION - Dopamine sensitivity determines how much stimulation you need to feel rewarded and focused - Over-stimulation desensitizes dopamine receptors, requiring more stimulation for the same reward - You can''t detox dopamine but you can resensitize yourself to it through strategic boredom  BORING BREAKS STRATEGY - Take breaks that are less stimulating than your work to reset reward sensitivity - Wall staring, napping, walking, stretching, or mindfulness work better than social media breaks - The goal is to make work feel as easy as scrolling social media by lowering your boredom baseline  INHABIT THE IN-BETWEEN - Use waiting moments (lines, lunch breaks, commuting) without reaching for your phone - Allow yourself to simply settle and be present instead of consuming information - These moments train your brain to tolerate low stimulation and increase reward sensitivity  SINGLE-TASKING MASTERY - Do everything one thing at a time to heighten reward sensitivity - Rapid shifting between default mode network and task positive network improves focus speed - Singular focus trains your brain to access flow states faster and more reliably","@AlviSheikh-911","4"

"Christ, this is the most useful YouTube video I''ve watched in months, if not years. I already started taking boring breaks recently and they''ve been working wonders for my ability to focus and be disciplined with my time, but the other two steps you mention hit personally. Especially in the evening, I find myself craving some YT Shorts while getting the kids ready for bed. Any brief moment, I rush to pick up my phone and get even a few seconds in, and every time I do it, I question why the hell I''m doing it. Somehow in that moment my brain is just craving the dopamine I get instead of staying focused on the bedtime ritual with kids--like, what''s the point? And for doing everything one at a time, well, NOT doing that is the main reason I hardly get things done and instead waste time on YouTube, not enjoying it because I feel guilty for not doing things I need to, but also feeling bad while doing them because I always feel there''s something else I should be doing instead.  I''m determined to take these three easy steps in order to improve my productivity and, to be honest, my self-esteem, because even after a full day of doing things, I can easily feel down on myself for not being as organized or as productive as I could have been, if only I had had more self-control.

"Just one little thing needs to be implemented to do 80% of the improvements: Just be comfortable being bored sometimes.  You''re bored at work because the rest of your life is more stimulating. Now try to be bored on your own time sometimes. You can still indulge, but just try being bored during your commute, coffee break etc and you''ll notice work flows out from you so much more easily. You don''t even have to do it every day. It works by the law of diminishing returns, which means that that first little bit that you can do already does some major work. Every little bit is extremely useful until you''ve gone quite far with this.","@lphoogenboom",""

"Landon talks about how modern life pushes us toward instant gratification — scrolling, porn, junk food, endless entertainment. But those habits train dopamine to expect rewards without work. To reverse that, you must embrace resistance: workouts, studying, skill-building, waking up early. At first, your brain fights back, craving the old easy hits. But when you stick with the struggle long enough, the brain adapts — and suddenly, you want to push yourself. Hard work becomes addictive because achievement feels incredible when you earn it.","@sustainabledevelopment-x7c",""

"I have ADHD, which means my DRD2 gene, which encodes the dopamine D2 receptors on the postsynaptic neurons is mutated, as well as my DAT1, DRD4, VNTR, SNP and noradrenaline transporter genes. To simplify what this means, my brain is either over or under prunes synaptic connections, leading to the mutated DRD2 gene to either over influence the product of dopamine transporters, or under influence it.  When it''s under influencing the production of transporters, less dopamine is able to move from the gland to the postsynaptic cleft, resulting in each action requiring additional neurochemical work since each neuron is going to have to reuptake the neuromodulators they have since less is able to resupply the bunch, leaving less dopamine neurotransmitters to be used throughout the brain(what we call our dull days). When it over influences the production of transporters, we have our hyper focus moments, or just general hyper moments. This mutation to these genes happens in postnatal, and are not influenced by environmental factors. If you happen to have one of these inherited mutated genes from a parent, but it''s recessive, you are at a higher risk of onsetting or aggravating like ADHD traits through environmental factors, but if you don''t have any genetic markers for it, watching Tik Tok isn''t going to ""cause"" ADHD, or are ""vaccines"", since they assert these genes in isolated regions of the world where they never had connection to the outside, but still had markers for these mutated genes.

"Alright, according the baseline of this video, your explanation could include a bit disinformation for people who suffers from it, from the perspective and investigation of a prescribed ADHD person for like 30 years now.  First definition of dopamine... Dopamine is never about reward, it is about ANTICIPATION of reward. So doses of dopamine is more related to your anticipation rather than the reward you get from the stimulant disregarding other physiological, stress/hormone responses, nutrition affects, etc. So is it about how able you are to control the anticipation of reward? So is it about if you can even regulate your receptor count,  and so on? Or is it about how your PFC have properly grown compared to your amygdala growth rate during your life period from fetus to 25 y/o. Yes it is different scenery and it is not mouldable/adjustable just changing habits or way of thinking or doing that/this. etc. This ""might"" work if you have proper/healthy brain  development, still there are questions due to definitions.  It can work as if you are trying to quit coffee... Not cigarete, not alcohol, not other very addictive stuff... Dopamine is very very very addictive. And lack of it just shears your motivation to do anything. Yet it is still not a depression but can cause one. That should be identified properly by an expert. You can get it back on track by reuptake pills, or direct dopamine release one... Does not matter in long term. When you use it long term the receptor mechanism kicks in, as you have mentioned for other cases and clauses,  and you hardly can recognise the benefits. Aka this works for all addictions, but hard addictions are still hard for science at the year 2024. So, don''t we have an option? We do. But that does not lie in this video. We have a different homeostasis that does not work for system, aka we are not normal. I am any kind of dopamine suggestive drug free for like 5  years now. My life is not as normal as I was getting drugs but I can just manage. Our cycles are different, our anticipation system is different, our rewards, our hedonias are different. You can adjust life according to that. First do not jump into those videos, 2nd do not rely on drugs unless you can''t manage your life alone, that can be a temp solution for sure with an expert, 3rd try to find and bring people around you, your partner, friends etc. who recognises you with this anomaly as who you are. Try to find people who are comfortable with this. That will give you some space to breath and drastically reduce your chronic cortisol levels. Finally take out other ""unnecessary"" cortisol resources, such as disinformative advises about dopamine, aggressive social media as you can, the people who always come to you to whine etc.  Define your constant cortisol creators and remove them. Eg. I deleted my twitter, instagram, and other social media platforms, just youtube left. I got so far by trying  those, I can manage my company, family and my life in a moderate state. I am not pure successful or anything, I still have botches, rinse and repeats. I just can maintain life without drugs or unnecessary normalisation attempts which never worked. So this video is partially ok to try to remove cortisol providers, other that unfortunately it is an advise that might work for a mild percentence of neurodiversity without defining the cause. It is not a subject to generalize and give a whole working treatment. I might be totally wrong in longer terms as I could only test mine for like 5 years. My mere experience and research, my 50 cents to you and your followers that you might rightfully, normally, totally ignore.","@leventpasha","1"

"This is the first video from that channel that I came upon. The message sounds great, I will definitely try ""boring breaks"". But the form of this video is audacious. Music is loud, screen flickers all the time, words pop at you. It was really a struggle to understand what you are saying and needed to wrestle through annoyance to watch this till the end. It''s odd, cause it looks like it contradicts your message.","@mareker",""
"SO...  Take ""boring"" breaks to let your brain settle.  Also, DO NOT try to ""multitask.""  So-called multitasking actually FRACTURES your focus.  And our focus is already pretty weak, and ""multitasking"" is actually NOT possible in any sustainable way.  Multitasking is just refocusing back and forth between things.  Sustained refocusing is what is causing our modern fatigue.  We NEED lower stimulation, and especially lower NUMBERS of stimuli.  Those people that THINK they can study better with TV, radio and their phone going all at once, are FOOLING themselves.  Yes, this keeps their brain ""revved up.""  So they THINK they''re getting a lot done; when in fact they''re getting next to nothing done and just keeping their brain revved up with tons of distractions.","@BldgsFallStraightDwn",""
